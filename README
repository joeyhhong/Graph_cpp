C++ Graph and Graph Algorithms
======================================

Written By: Joey Hong

This will be a compilation of my graph implementations, along with various, popular graph algorithms. It is still rather primitive right now, but will be updated on a frequent basis.

----------------------------------------

The main program can be compiled by typing 'make' in the bash, and 'make zip' will also create a .zip folder of all the files.

To run the program, type in the bash:

./graph-test -f <filename> or

./graph-test < <filename>

A sample input file 'graph.in' has been included to show that the file should look like.
